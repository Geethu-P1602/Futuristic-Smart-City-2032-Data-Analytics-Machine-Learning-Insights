# Futuristic Smart City 2032
Data Analytics and Machine Learning Project

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing smart city data and predicting how different city factors may change by the year 2032. The dataset includes information related to population growth, energy usage, traffic, pollution, and infrastructure. By applying data analytics techniques and machine learning models, the project aims to understand patterns in the data and generate useful insights that can support future urban planning and smart city development.

## Technologies Used
Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, and Power BI.

## Methodology

1. Data Collection  
   The smart city dataset was collected containing key attributes such as population, traffic density, energy consumption, pollution levels, and infrastructure indicators.

2. Data Preprocessing  
   The data was cleaned by handling missing values, correcting data types, and removing inconsistencies to make it suitable for analysis.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis  
   Statistical analysis and visualizations were performed to understand data distribution, relationships between features, and overall trends.

4. Feature Selection and Preparation  
   Important features were selected and transformed to improve the performance of machine learning models.

5. Machine Learning Modeling  
   The dataset was split into training and testing sets. Suitable machine learning algorithms were applied to build predictive models and evaluate their performance.

6. Visualization  
   Power BI was used to create an interactive dashboard to visually present insights and future predictions.
